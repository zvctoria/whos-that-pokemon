## Who's That Pokémon?

An interactive website inspired by the classic "Who's That Pokémon" television segments. Players guess the Pokémon by listening to its cry, with each incorrect attempt revealing hints such as its type, weight, debut game, abilities, and eventually its sprite. Includes customisable settings for a personalised experience and leverages PokéAPI for the most accurate, up-to-date Pokémon data.
